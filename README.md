# E-Learning System 🎓

A scalable **E-Learning Backend System** built using **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **PostgreSQL**, following clean architecture principles and real-world backend best practices.

This project is designed to manage users, courses, enrollments, and student profiles with proper role-based access control and a clean relational database structure.

---

## Overview

The E-Learning System provides a robust backend foundation for an online learning platform where:

- **Instructors** can create and manage courses and lessons.
- **Students** can enroll in courses and manage their profiles.
- **Admins** have full control over the system.
- Data integrity is preserved using proper relations and cascade rules.

The project focuses on **backend correctness, scalability, and clean code**.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure access.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ensuring users only access what they are permitted to.
- Guards for protecting sensitive endpoints.

### User Management
- distinct roles: **Admin**, **Instructor**, **Student**.
- Secure password hashing (typically using bcrypt).

### Course Management
- **Courses**: Create, update, delete, and view courses.
- **Lessons**: structured content within courses.
- **Dynamic Ordering**: Lessons can be ordered and reordered within a course.

### Enrollments
- Students can enroll in available courses.
- Tracking of enrollment status.

### Student Profiles
- Dedicated profiles for students to manage their personal information and progress.

### Architecture
- **Modular NestJS structure**: Separation of concerns into specific modules.
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for robust request validation.
- **TypeORM**: specific entities and relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-One).

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
# Optional: JWT_EXPIRATION=3600s
```

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e-learning-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

1. **Development Mode**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Project Structure

```bash
src/
├── config/             # Database and global configuration
├── modules/            # Feature modules
│   ├── users/          # User management & Auth
│   ├── courses/        # Courses & Lessons management
│   ├── enrollments/    # Course enrollment handling
│   └── profiles/       # Student profiles
├── app.module.ts       # Main application module
└── main.ts             # Application entry point
```

Each module typically contains:
- `*.controller.ts`: Handles incoming requests.
- `*.service.ts`: Contains business logic.
- `*.entity.ts`: Database models.
- `dto/`: Data Transfer Objects for validation.

---

## Roles

The system is designed with specific permissions for:
- **ADMIN**: Full system access.
- **INSTRUCTOR**: Can manage their own courses and lessons.
- **STUDENT**: Can view courses, enroll, and manage their profile.
