# E-Learning System 🎓

A scalable **E-Learning Backend System** built using **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **PostgreSQL**, following clean architecture principles and real-world backend best practices.

This project is designed to manage users, courses, and lessons with proper role-based access control and a clean relational database structure.

---

## 📌 Overview

The E-Learning System provides a backend foundation for an online learning platform where:

- Instructors can create courses and lessons
- Students can access educational content
- Admins can manage the system
- Lessons are ordered correctly inside courses
- Data integrity is preserved using proper relations

The project focuses on **backend correctness, scalability, and clean code**, rather than UI.
